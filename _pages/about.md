<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a graduate student in School of Computer and Information Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University, luckily advised by Prof. Yi Liu. I received B.S. in Computer Science from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2020. I am also a research intern at Cognitive Computing Lab, Baidu Research, luckily advised by Dr. Zeke Xie.

I am interested in 3D vision and autonomous driving , and my current research focuses on leveraging neural fields to enhance the quality and the robustness in autonomous driving simulations.

**I am actively looking for a PhD position for Fall 2024! Check out my [CV](https://madaoer.github.io/assets/Xindi_Yang_CV.pdf) here.**
