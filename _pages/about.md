<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a final year graduate student at Beijing Jiaotong University. My recent research interesting is research on machine learning for neural fields to enhance the quality and the robustness in autonomous driving simulations leveraging advanced AI technologies, including NeRF, generative models, to enhance the quality and the robustness in autonomous driving simulations. Beyond the applicaions in autonomous driving, I am also interested in extend the neural fields methods to science area. 

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
